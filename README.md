# mp3-multi-language
merge two mp3 files 5 second blocks each

I've used the program to assist learning a language.  

The program takes two input mp3 files, in different languages, translation of each other at the same cadence. 
The output is a combined mp3 file twice as long with both languages alternating at x second intervals.


Future improvements:
 * find natural pauses in the mp3 instead of the input interval in seconds.
